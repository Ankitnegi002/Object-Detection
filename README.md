There are two program for object detection. One work locally and another one work globally. 
This problem occur due to the YOLO module, the size of YOLO algorithm is very high due to this i can't upload it on GitHub. 
That is why i have to perform some changes in my base code to make it run globally. 

NOTE: At first Global program will take around 5 minute to download the YOLO module file. After that it will run smoothly.
